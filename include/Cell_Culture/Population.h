 *
 * @brief This class is a representation of the complete society of cell existence and interactions.
 *
 * @details The Population constitutes of all current, previous and future generations of cells, both living and dead
 * as well as those not yet born. By mapping all cells to their respective positions in the simulation world,
 * Population has the complete knowledge of each cell's whereabouts. Furthermore, the class is responsible for
 * determining which rules should be required from the RuleFactory, and store the pointer to these as members.
 *
 * Population's main responsibility during execution is determining which rule to apply for each new generation
 * and updating the cells to their new states.
 * 
 * @test The constructor and each public function in this class should be tested with a separate test function
