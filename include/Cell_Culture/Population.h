 *
 * @brief This class is a representation of the complete society of cell
 existence and interactions.
 *
 * @details The Population constitutes of all current, previous and future
 generations of cells, both living and dead
 * as well as those not yet born. By mapping all cells to their respective
 positions in the simulation world,
 * Population has the complete knowledge of each cell's whereabouts.
 Furthermore, the class is responsible for
 * determining which rules should be required from the RuleFactory, and store
 the pointer to these as members.
 *
 * Population's main responsibility during execution is determining which rule
 to apply for each new generation
 * and updating the cells to their new states.
 *
 * @test The constructor and each public function in this class should be tested
 with a separate test function
