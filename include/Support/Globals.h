 * @brief this header file contains global data members used throughout the
 * simulation.
 * @details certain data structures might need to be accessed globally. These
 * should preferably be const declared
 * @issue This file contains global variables that can be accessed and changed
 * by any class in the solution. Global variables should be avoided, and a
 * better solution would be to add these structures as private members of
 * classes that uses them with relevant set and get functions.
