   * Identification strings

   * Test Recommendation
   * - Create a VonNeumann rule
   * - Create a Eric rule
   * - A invalid name should return a Conway rule
   * - A empty input should return a Conway rule
   * - What happends if a nullptr is supplied?
   *
   * @issue It would be good to define constants tha can be used by callers.
