   * @brief Create an instance of the wanted RuleOfExistence

   * if an invalid name is supplied Conway is used.
   * Identification strings
   *  - von_neumann
   *  - eric
   *
   * Test Recommendation
   * - Create a VonNeumann rule
   * - Create a Eric rule
   * - A invalid name should return a Conway rule
   * - A empty input should return a Conway rule
   * - What happends if a nullptr is supplied?
   *
   * @test That the expected class is created
   * @test That invalid rule names creates a Conway rule
   * @test That if no rule is given, default, a Conway rule is created
   *
   * @issue It would be good to define constants tha can be used by callers
   * for class identification string. Such ass RuleOfExistence_Erik.CLASS_NAME
   *
   * @param cells Game board
   * @param ruleName string of the rule name to use
   * @return RuleOfInstance* reference to the instance of the created rule
