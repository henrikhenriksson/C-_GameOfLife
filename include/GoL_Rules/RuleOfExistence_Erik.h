 * @details Concrete Rule of existence, implementing Erik's rule.
 * Sentient lifeforms is rarely created, but once in a while a cell has lived
 * enough generations to become as wise as Erik.
 * - Once a cell has survived a minimum amount of generations it will
 * receive a color to distinguish itself from younger ones.
 * - If such a cell would then survive another set amount of generations, it
 * will be marked with a value of **E**.
 * - In the extreme case, where the cell has achieved above requirements and
 * is determined to be the oldest living cell, it will
 * become a **prime elder**, and have its color changed once again. A generation
 * may only have one such elder.
 *
 * @issue The class name "conway" should be declared as a class constant that
 * is accessable from the outside
